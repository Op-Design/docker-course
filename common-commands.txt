1. Build an image from a Dockerfile:
        docker -t build image_name path_to_dockerfile
                # Example
                docker -t build myapp .

2. List all local images:
        docker images
                # Example
                docker ls

3. Pull an image from Docker Hub:
        docker pull image_name:tag
                # Example
                docker pull nginx:latest

4. Remove a local image:
        docker rmi image_name:tag
                # Example
                docker rmi myapp:latest
        docker rm [image_name/image_id]
                # Example
                docker rm fd484f19954f

5. Tag an image:
        docker tag source_image:tag new_image:tag
                # Example
                docker tag myapp:latest myapp:v1
